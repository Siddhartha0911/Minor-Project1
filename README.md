This is my Project on Breast Cancer Detection.
The dataset used is Wisconsin Dataset which holds 569 samples. However small but the correlativity of features among themselves makes is enough to apply Classfication Models 
as well as Neural Network to predict the outcome.
I have used Python as well as R language to complete this project.
Reason I choose python was primarily due the reason that it is excellent in handling tenses also the keras and sklearn packages are very useful. Details of the architecture of Neural Network 
and its performance is mentioned in the Documentation.
The other approach of classification using Classification models was done in R language.
